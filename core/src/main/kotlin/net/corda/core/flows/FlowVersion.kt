/**
 * Annotation for client-side [FlowLogic]s to specify the version of their flow protocol. The version is a single integer
 * [value] which increments by one whenever a release is made where the flow protocol changes in any manner which is
 * backwards incompatible. This may be a change in the sequence of sends and receives between the client and service flows,
 * or it could be a change in the meaning.
 *
 * This flow version integer is not the same as Corda's platform version, though it follows a similar semantic.
 *
 * Only one version of the same flow can currently be loaded at the same time. Any session request by a client flow for
 * a different version will be rejected.
 *
 * Defaults to a flow version of 1 if not specified.
